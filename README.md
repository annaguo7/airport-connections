# airport-connections
In this lab, you will build a coordinated visualization showing airport connections worldwide. You will create a node-link diagram using [d3-force](https://github.com/d3/d3-force) and a geographical map using [d3-geo](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo), and coordinate both through animated transitions.
